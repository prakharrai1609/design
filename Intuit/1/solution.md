A high-level system for this problem:

1. **Device Location Tracking System:**
   - Utilize GPS-enabled devices or rely on Wi-Fi/cellular network triangulation for location tracking.
   - Devices periodically send their location data to a central server.
   - Implement secure and privacy-compliant protocols to handle location data.

2. **Data Storage:**
   - Store location data in a centralized database.
   - Implement proper security measures to protect sensitive location information.

3. **Free Time Slot Calculation:**
   - Integrate calendar data for each person, detailing their busy times.
   - Develop an algorithm to identify overlapping free time slots.
   - The algorithm should consider the duration of the free time slots and prioritize longer periods for better scheduling flexibility.

4. **User Interface:**
   - Create a user-friendly interface where users can input their busy times, view their schedules, and request suggestions for meetings.

5. **Notification System:**
   - Implement a notification system to inform users about potential free time slots and meeting suggestions.

6. **Privacy Controls:**
   - Allow users to control the level of detail shared in terms of location and schedule.
   - Implement robust privacy settings to ensure user data security.

7. **Integration with Calendar Apps:**
   - Enable integration with popular calendar applications to streamline the input of busy times and synchronization of schedules.

8. **Machine Learning (Optional):**
   - Consider implementing machine learning algorithms to predict future busy times based on historical data.

9. **Scalability:**
   - Design the system to handle a growing number of users and devices, ensuring scalability.

10. **Security Measures:**
    - Employ encryption for data transmission and storage.
    - Implement access controls to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive information.

11. **Compliance:**
    - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations and privacy laws.

12. **Feedback Mechanism:**
    - Allow users to provide feedback on suggested meeting times, helping the system improve its recommendations over time.

13. **Support Multiple Platforms:**
    - Develop applications for various platforms (web, mobile) to cater to a wider user base.

14. **Offline Support:**
    - Consider implementing offline functionality, allowing users to input their schedules and receive suggestions even when not connected to the internet.

15. **Continuous Improvement:**
    - Regularly update the system based on user feedback and technological advancements to enhance its performance and features.
